## Background

The Indiana University (IU) application for admission is the way prospective undergraduate students can apply online for admission to any of IU's nine state-wide campuses.

### The problem

The previous online application for admission was approximately ten years old when we began this initiative in 2017. The underlying technology was outdated, particularly the user interface (UI), which had never been optimized for mobile devices.

### My Role

About a month after the project began, I joined the team working on it. The team had already built a few placeholder pages and set up database connections. The UX designers had designed the application as a multi-step form with multiple branching scenarios dependent on the applicant's answers to particular questions.

It was my role to produce polished visual designs based on the wireframes and then deliver static HTML and CSS prototype screens to the developers.

## Process

After a few initial meetings with the UX designers and developers, I created static mockups for each screen of the application. Based on the existing wireframes, there were several points in the application where the applicant's answer would result in a progressive disclosure of different sets of form fields. Part of the challenge in this phase of the project was making sure account for the different branching scenarios. I collaborated closely with the UX/interaction designers to make sure we had created visual designs for each scenario.

Once the static UI designs were complete and approved by all stakeholders, I moved on to creating HTML mockups. My job was to faithfully recreate the static design mockups using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (for small interactions) and deliver accessible and production ready code to the developers building the app.

## Outcome

After handing of static HTML mockups, the developers were able to quickly build out the live application screens. The new application launched in fall of 2017 and is still in production today.

In addition to being implement in the front-end code base, the HTML and CSS I wrote for this project ended up serving as the starting point for IU's design system Rivet, the project I'm currently leading.
