## Background

Rivet is Indiana University's (IU) digital design system. It is a collection of templates, components, tools, and guidelines for designing digital interfaces at IU.

Product and development teams at IU use Rivet to create consistent products and websites faster. By removing the guesswork around usability, accessibility, and branding, it saves designers and developers time allowing them to focus on user needs and solving tough design problems.

### The problem

Outside of a set of content management system (CMS) templates that were being used to create brochure and informational websites, there was no common pattern library across product and software development teams before we started building Rivet. Typically, teams would choose generic pattern libraries like Bootstrap as the starting point for their apps and sites. This led to fragmented user experience (UX) across the systems students use to complete many essential tasks like the application for admission, academic planning, paying bursar bills, etc.

At the time my team was a part of the newly-formed User Experience Office (UXO) and were tasked by the Vice President for Information Technology's office with taking steps to improve the UX of IU's systems and applications. The lack of a consistent, IU-branded pattern library was a clear opportunity to have an impact on accomplishing UXO's goals of improving the consistency, usability, and accessibility of our digital systems. We started initial research and design work on Rivet shortly after in the Spring of 2018.

### My Role

I was the lead of design and development on the project. For the first three month phase, I oversaw a team of UX designers, UX architects, and developers that conducted initial research and design exploration. After the initial exploratory phase, I spent the next six months doing the majority of the front-end development and writing documentation for the first version released in Spring of 2019.

## Process

The project started with a workshop that brought together UX/UI designers, developers, and content specialists stakeholders from various units at the University. The goal of the workshop was to identify the bare minimum requirements for a design system prototype.

- Set constraint of 3 months for a prototype
- Prototype was successful enough to get sign off on building a full v1
- Set a goal to have v1 ready to launch in six months
	- I was given permission to focus full-time for the six month period
- I did the bulk of the design and development work for v1 with periodic review with members from the initial exploratory team.
- Spring of 2018 we held our first _town hall_ meeting to share progress and demo components and documentation for v1
- Released v1 in May of 2018
	- Adoption was slow at first but started to tick up through 2018 and in to 2019
	- Additional components, held workshops, created *Add-ons*
- Started planning for v2 in late 2019
	- In collaboration with Office of Vice President of Communications and Marketing
	- Expanded the scope to be flexible to apply to sites and applications.
- Work put on hold during pandemic, but resumed in spring 2021
- Released v2 summer of 2022

## Outcome

Version two of Rivet brings a much expanded set of components for both content-driven brochure sites and task-driven applications. It is made up of four main parts: design tokens, utilities, components, and layouts and includes a newly re-design documentation site with completely re-written documentation that is more clear and consistent.

### Results

In a 2021 IU Developer survey conducted by the User Experience Office's developer advocate, 65% of developers surveyed at IU reported using or planning to use Rivet in one of their projects. That was a nearly 20% increase compared to the same survey results from 2019.

In addition to the steady increase in adoption by developer, we saw several specific mentions of Rivet in the open-ended comments  at the end of the survey.

> Rivet saves developers a lot of time.

> Rivet makes it so much easier to make good applications.

### Impact of my work

Since initial release in 2018, Rivet has widely been seen as an exemplar of design systems in the higher education space. As project lead, I have been contacted by and met with several design and development teams at other universities that were trying to get their own design systems projects started.

Rivet has also been cited in several lists and articles as one of the most accessible design systems.

- [Web Accessible Code Libraries and Design Patterns](http://www.webaxe.org/web-accessible-code-library-design-systems-patterns/)
- [Stark - Examples of the best design systems that focuses more on accessibility.](https://www.getstark.co/library/design-systems)

### Lessons learned

The word "design system" can mean a lot of different things to different groups of people. Leading the Rivet design system project for the past four years, I've learned that you have spend the time to figure out what building a design system means for your organization. It's easy to look at one other company's are doing and think that their solutions will automatically apply to your situation, but real impact comes from understanding where the users of your design system are building and designing for the web and meeting them there.
