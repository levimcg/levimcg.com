I bought this book on a whim after hearing an interview with the author on [Weekend Edition](http://www.npr.org/2016/07/24/487083575/what-if-you-hadnt-gotten-married-dark-matter-imagines-an-alternate-life) one afternoon a few weeks back. It's the story of a community college physics professor who wakes up one day to find that his life has taken a completely different path. He's now the world-renowned physicist that he had once been destined to be before he decided to start a family with the woman he loved.

It's a great thriller that was a super fast and enjoyable read. Everything about it made me think it would make a pretty great movie too. And, according to the acknowledgements in the back, the author is currently in talks to adapt it for film.

I'd go see it.
