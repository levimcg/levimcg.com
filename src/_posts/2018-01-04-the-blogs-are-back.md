If you hadn't notice, Twitter has become a toxic shit pile. It seems to me that a growing number of the folks that I admire and follow there are starting to walk away from the platform. It's a total bum out and Twitter has totally allowed it to happen. Mike Monteiro's [one of those folks](https://medium.com/@monteiro/jack-dorseys-resignation-letter-to-twitter-b04e8a63b0a9) and he really nailed it here:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I wish you’d spent just a portion of the energy you use defending fascists listening to the people they’re attacking <a href="https://twitter.com/jack?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@jack</a>. Some of those voices are silenced forever. You did nothing. Except make sure their attackers still had a platform. I hope they haunt your dreams.</p>&mdash; Mike Monteiro wants @jack fired. (@monteiro) <a href="https://twitter.com/monteiro/status/947314123871633408?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 31, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

It's sad to watch Twitter slowly die like this, but it's happening and they know it. It's why they allow the abusive fascists to flourish and a maniac with millions of followers and the ability to destroy the world threaten nuclear war. Whatver drives engagment, I guess.

All that said, there's at least one good thing to come out of all this. It seems, at least a little bit, that people are starting to take control of their own content. I don't think it's a mass exodus by any means, but I've noticed a lot of those same folks I follow starting to publish more of their content on their own sites or via newsletters. That's exciting to me so I thought I'd share some of my favorite blogs I read and newsletters I subscribe to. I might try to keep it up to date as I discover new stuff.

## 1. [Austin Kleon][kleon-blog]
[Austin's blog][kleon-blog] is one of the most active and chalked full of great posts. He also has a weekly newsletter that goes out every friday. It's one of my favorites.

## 2. [Wine Folly][wine-folly]
I spent a lot of time last year learning more about wine and Wine Folly is a great resource. They also publish a weekly email newsletter which is great too.

## 3. [Go Make Things][go-make-things]
I spent quite a bit of time writing JavaScript for a big project this year. I signed up for Chris Ferdinandi's daily JS tips, and it's been a really helpful. He does a great job of distiling complicated concepts into short, practical examples.

## 4. [Sidebar][sidebar]
Sidebar is a great daily list of five articles about design, UX, and web development. It's basically like a _best-of_ list from Design Twitter delivered to your inbox everyday.

## 5. [CSS Tricks][css]
I find myself on this site almost daily after a google search for some obscure CSS thing. I always stay and read a couple of articles though. If you do any kind of front end web development or want to learn, this site is an amazing resource.

## And a few others
I know I'm missing some, but these are a few other personal blogs/newsletters/sites I really enjoy.
