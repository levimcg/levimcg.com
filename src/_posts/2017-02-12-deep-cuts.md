Last Friday, Febreuary 3 was the opening for my show called Deep Cuts at [Blueline Gallery](http://thisisblueline.com/). It's a collection of my work from the last year or so that includes a bunch of new original artwork and prints, icluding some from my [Relatives project](http://relatives.levimcg.com/).

I didn't get a ton of photos from the event, but here's one of the shots of the main wall I grabbed with my phone on the night. I know it's kinda blurry.

## Sketchbook video

I also made this video of the sketchbook I've kept for the last few months. There was tons of great work in here that I wanted to show, but didn't really want to rip out the pages. This video was the solution. It ran in a loop on a big monitor during the opening reception.
