I caught the last 10 minutes of [this Fresh Air interview with Robert Siegel][siegel] tonight on my way to dinner. He's retiring on January 5 after a 40-plus years at NPR. His has been a constant voice in my drive home since I got a job with a job day-time schedule. Hearing about how public radio has evolved during his career and his struggles with staying relevant got me thinking about my own career making things for the web.

I'm 36-years-old. Under current [Social Security Administration regulations][retirement] I've got 31 years until I can officially _retire_. I have more years I'm legally obligated to work than the industry in which I work **has been in existence**. Has any generation ever been in that situation, and at the same time been able to **blog** about it?

I'm optomistic, but cautious, to see where this industry _is_ headed. Has there ever been a resource capable of spreading so much good and [evil at the same time][monteiro]? I'm hoping for the former.
