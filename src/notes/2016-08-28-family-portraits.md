My wife and son were out of town for the weekend visiting some family, so I got a house all to myself. I spent all of Friday night drawing and listening to records. It was so much fun and totally refreshing.

My wife has been asking me to sketch some portraits of her, my son, and myself for a while and she was pretty pleased with the results. I used some new brushes and ink I had bought earlier and realized how much I like working in this loose sketchy style.
