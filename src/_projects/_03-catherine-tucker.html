        <h2>Style Guide Driven</h2>
        <p>I started off by doing a lot of work on the base styling and CSS architecture of the site first in the form of a <a href="http://drcatherinetucker.com/web-style-guide" target="_blank">web style guide</a>. Once I had a solid base of styes in place I was able to quickly create components and prototypes to show the client.</p>

        <h2>Look and feel deliverables</h2>
        <p>From the very begining of the project I let the client know that I would not be presenting polished static mockups, but that I would be making look and feel pages using the styles and compontents I was building for the style guide.</p>
