slug: page-by-page
description: I worked with representatives from the Monroe County Youth Council to created a visual identity system for a new literacy program  based The Search Institute's 40 Developmental Assets. The identity uses boldly-colored imagery of building blocks in reference to the program's mission to help build young people into successful and contributing adults.
