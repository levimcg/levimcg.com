Hi, I'm Levi McGranahan. I am a designer and front-end web developer based in Indiana. I've been designing and building for all types of screens for more than 15 years.

## Currently
For the last four years I've been working on the [Rivet design system](https://rivet.iu.edu/) at [Indiana University](https://www.iu.edu/index.html)â€”a top public research university based in Bloomington where I live.

This is my personal site where I capture [notes](/tags/notes/) and [ideas](/blog/). It's also the space I use as a playground to learn new CSS, JavaScript, and design concepts.
