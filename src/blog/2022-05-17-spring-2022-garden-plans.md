I'm glad the weather is finally starting to turn and it really feels like Spring. We've had a run of warm days and nights this last week and all my transplants and seedlings are starting to take off. I love all the potential of this time of year.

Here's what I've got that's either already planted or ready to.

- 10 pepper plants
- 13 tomato
- 3 Kale plants
- 2 rows of beets (~ 8-12 beets)
- 3 Swiss chard
- 4 cilantro
- 3 thyme
- 2 oregano
- 4 basil
- 2 dill
- 10 lettuce
- 5 arugula
- 3 purple broccoli
- 3 marigold
- 2 nasturtiums
- 4 fennel
- Lots of radish
