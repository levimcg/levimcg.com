My friend text me a link the other day to [some music](https://open.spotify.com/track/0cciBj4236w1xByzZvn92D?si=WozsVYWKSA-dgYjPb9wBJQ) they thought I should check out. We like a few of the same bands, but I really have no idea what all types of music they like.

Turns out the link they sent was pretty good stuff. Not necessarily something I would seek out, but I ended up listening to most of the record. It's definitely something I'd put on in the background while I'm cooking dinner.

I've been trying to do my best to at least try and listen, read, or watch when someone in my life sends me a link to something they like or found interesting. It's a tiny gesture, but it means they thought about me and they took time out of their day to commit to a potential conversation. If I stop and think about it, that's really cool and makes me feel good.
