I redesign my personal site at the beginning of the year. I was bored and wanted to try out all of the new and exciting CSS features that I don't always get a chance to use in my day job. I also thought that it might help make me post on my blog more oftenâ€”build some *momentum*.

Momentum implies that you need to build a certain amount of speed or output to keep going. To me that feels like a trap. Consistency...that's where it's at. I consistently write posts here on my site about about five or six times a year. Every year.

I've done so *consistently* for about seven years now and you know what? That's pretty good.
