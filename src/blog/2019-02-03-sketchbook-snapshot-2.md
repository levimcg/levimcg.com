It's been a while since I did a sketchbook snapshot. I was cleaning and organizing my home office this afternoon when I found a bunch of drawings from late 2018 that I've only ever posted on Instagram. These were all done with my [Krink K60](https://shop.krink.com/products/k-60-paint-marker). I love that marker!
