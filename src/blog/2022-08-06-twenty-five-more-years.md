I Gave my old bass a makeover today—a quick list of what I upgraded.

- Pickup(s) — Seymour Duncan Quarter Pound
- Fender Hight Mass bridge
- New pickguard
- Chrome knobs
- Strap buttons

I bought this guitar in 1997 with a few paychecks from my first real job at Taco Bell in high school. I put a lot of miles on this thing in basements/garages/VFWs/coffee shops/bars over the years. It still rips.

Twenty five years ago Musician's Friend didn't have a website. It was a printed catalog made of paper with pictures, specs, and prices of gear that came to your house once a month. I gave my Mom the cash and then called a real person on the phone to use her credit card to place my order.
