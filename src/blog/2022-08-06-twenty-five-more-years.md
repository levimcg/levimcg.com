I Gave my old bass a makeover today—a quick list of what I upgraded.

- Pickup(s) — Seymore Duncan Quareter Pound 
- Fender Hight Mass bridge
- New pickguard
- Chrome knobs
- Strap buttons

I bought this guitar in 1997 with a few paychecks from first real job at Taco Bell in high school. I put a lot of miles on this thing in basements/garages/VFWs/coffee shops/bars over the years. It still rips.

Twenty five years ago—Musician's Friend didn't have a website. It was a catalog—a printed magazine made of paper that came to your house once a month with pictures, specs, and prices of gear. I had to give my Mom the cash and then call a real person on the phone to use her credit card to place my order.

Worth it!
