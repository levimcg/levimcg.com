I read [this article by Dan Mall](https://danmall.com/articles/its-easier-to-revise-than-create/) last week that really nails why it's important to not dwell in the creation phase of a project because it's easier to revise and improve once you get the initial ideas on paper.

There are designers that are comfortable creating something from nothing. Others excel at revising or redesigning. I think both are important and I often wonder which mode I should focus energy on.
