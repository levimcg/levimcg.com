Iâ€™m consistently inspired by the work of [Corita Kent](https://www.corita.org/). I love this quote. We are living through a slow-moving, totally avoidable tragedy. Any constructive acts we can muster are defiance. 

> Doing and making are acts of hope.

The [Corita Art Center](https://instagram.com/coritaartcenter) Instagram account is definitely worth a follow.
