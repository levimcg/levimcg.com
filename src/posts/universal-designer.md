I made this shitty stool in design school. It was supposed be able to hold the weight of a person. It did not. I'm don't know why, or how I ended up hanging on to it for all these years. I was a bad designer and I’m not really quite sure how I graduated.

But, I ended up doing ok. My career took a winding path. I got jobs selling TVs and making coffee. Then some jobs designing logos and brochures, and then eventually websites. When I got those design jobs I was aware enough to remember the important stuff I learned in school—have empathy for the people you’re designing for, talk to them, try to find out how the thing you’re designing can make their life easier, or better.

I believe that idea. It's what allowed me a career. I’m lucky to do what I do.
