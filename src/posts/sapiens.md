I picked this up on the recommendation of a friend. It's a whirlwind account of the history of Homo Sapiens (what we know as modern day humans). This book took me a while to get through, but it's absolutely fascinating. Chapter after chapter I found myself alternating between nodding along and being totally devastated by the bleakness of how we think and act as humans.

This was one of the best books I've read in a long time. Can't wait to ready the follow up, [Homo Deus](https://www.amazon.com/Homo-Deus-Brief-History-Tomorrow/dp/0062464310).
