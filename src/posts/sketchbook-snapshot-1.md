Whenever I'm feeling stuck creatively, spending some time in my sketchbook always helps. When I finish a book I archive it by writing the start and end dates on the spine and then putting them on a shelf in my office. After adding the new [Artwork section](../../artwork) to my site, I had the idea try and spend a little time each month catologing recent sketches/doodles and creating a little snapshop to post here. Here's the first one with a handful of pages from the last month or so.
