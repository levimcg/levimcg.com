I watched [this mini documentary](https://twitter.com/FoodInsider/status/1364454054332612608?s=20) about a French butter maker the other day that makes high-end butter with old techniques that very few places use anymore.

I really like this quote from the owner where he explains that he could make a lot more butter (and more money) if he using newer more automated techniques, but instead he prefers to focus on quality and do lessâ€”to make smaller things.

> Me, Iâ€™m a little good man and I make little things. 

I think about this concept a lot these days. The larger a project gets the quicker I find myself losing interest. Itâ€™s not that I fear hard work itâ€™s that I just want to do smaller, better work.

Anyway, watch this video about making butter. It appears that it only exists as this Tweet. I couldn't find it on Insider site, so I've embedded it here. Enjoy!
