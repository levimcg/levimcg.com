A little while ago I wrote about how [I started a new job](../whats-next) at the begining of this year. About a month after that I had my first solo [art show](../deep-cuts). Work has kept me pretty busy and to be honest, I've barely had the energy to create much art in what spare time I've had.

I don't think there will ever be a time where I don't have the urge to make _some_ kind of art. Creative fullfillment is something that I need in my life, and the urge to pursure it never really goes away. I'm lucky because even though my job doesn't involve making art, I _do_ get a lot of the same sense of fullfillment out [the work I'm doing](../whats-next/#design-systems).

I still carve out a little time here and there to make new stuff. It's a slow drip, but here are some new pieces I've made over the last few months.

## Small Works Holiday Group Show
I'll be showing a handful of pieces (maybe some of these new ones ☝️) at the Blueline Gallery again this coming month. It's a [group show](https://www.visitbloomington.com/event/small-works-holiday-show/36492/) with a few other local artists and it'll be up until December 29.
