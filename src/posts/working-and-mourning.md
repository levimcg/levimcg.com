Iâ€™m not religious, but when I looked out my front window yesterday morning at the church across the street from my house I felt my heart sink a little when I saw a completely empty parking. It was Easter morning.

We're all mourning something right now. The loss of the ability to see friends, of being able to shake a hand, to give a hug. The loss of freedom to do whatever we want. I'm really lucky that this virus hasn't directly touched my life. None of my family or friends have contracted it and the town I live in has seen very few confirmed cases, and no deaths yet.

It might seem weird when we look back one day at how we even cared about trying to keep building web pages when the world was such a mess.
