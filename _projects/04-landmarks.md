title: Landmarks
description: I started these drawings as a way to do something for meâ€”no client, no creative director, just scratching an itch I had to make <em>something</em>. Having recently relocated to Bloomington, Indiana, I looked to my new hometown for inspiration. I started posting each drawing on Instagram and after a great reception I decided to make prints of <a href="http://levimcg.com/landmarks/" target="_blank">some of my favorites</a>.
